#Reddit Clone

This application has been deployed with Heroku [here](https://sleepy-brushlands-24740.herokuapp.com/login/new)

The goal of building this application was to become for familiar with MVC
architecture in Rails. This Reddit Clone aims to create a relationship of users,
links (or posts), and comments to explore ideas like password authentication,
login, and nested attributes and resources.

Development and test were done using SQLite3 but the project was deployed
to a PostgreSQL database.

Please feel free to visit the site and poke around. Any feed back or
recommendations are much appreciated.
